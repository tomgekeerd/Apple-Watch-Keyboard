# Apple-Watch-Keyboard
Apple Watch Keyboard in T9 style for text input. Made this keyboard a couple of months ago for an update I was building for an existing app, but pulled the update and eventually thought it would be nice to open source it. 

# The App

Now, this keyboard isn't rocketscience, far from actually but does a really good job of getting text input in your Apple Watch if you really need it (and Apple isn't rejecting it if you implement it well enough). Because my plans were to make this update in a couple of days, the code isnt that neat unfortunately, but it does the job. Maybe I will look into it one day to clean it up. Have fun with it.
